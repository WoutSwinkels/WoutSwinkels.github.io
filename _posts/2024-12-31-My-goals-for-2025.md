In 2024, I turned 30, and for the first time in my life, I am going to write down my personal and professional goals for 2025. By the end of 2025, I will make this post publicly available to show how many of my goals I have accomplished. Why not publish it on January 1st, you may ask? Talk is cheap. I want to crush my goals in silence and let the results speak for themselves. Letâ€™s get to it. Here are my goals.

Personal goals
- [ ] Defend my PhD
- [ ] Learn to skydive
- [ ] Laser eye surgery
- [ ] Get a motorcycle license

Professional  goals
- [ ] Develop a VR game
- [ ] Develop a commercial MR application
- [ ] Become Nix/NixOS core contributor
- [ ] Start a software house
